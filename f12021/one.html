                        <p>The 2021 Formula 1 season kicked off in Bahrain, setting the stage for what would become one of the most intense and controversial seasons in F1 history. Lewis Hamilton led for most of the race, but in the closing laps, Max Verstappen was closing in with fresher tires. With just a few laps to go, Max overtook Hamilton around the outside of Turn 4 but exceeded track limits in the process. As a result, he was ordered to give the position back to avoid a penalty. Despite his best efforts, Verstappen was unable to mount another challenge, and Hamilton held on to claim the first win of the season.</p>

                        <p>At the start, Max Verstappen made an aggressive move on Lewis Hamilton into Turn 1 on the first lap. The wet conditions made the race extremely challenging, and while Verstappen excelled in the rain, Hamilton struggled and made mistakes. Despite dropping down the order, Hamilton fought back through the field and finished second, while Verstappen controlled the race and secured his first win of the season.</p>

                        <p>The race saw an intense battle between the top three contenders, Lewis Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas, and Max Verstappen. At the start, Bottas led the race, with Hamilton and Verstappen close behind. A slightly slow pit stop for Bottas allowed Verstappen to take second place, but neither could challenge Hamilton, who secured his second win of the season.</p>

                        <p>Max Verstappen took the lead on the first lap after an aggressive move on Lewis Hamilton into Turn 1. Red Bull opted for a one-stop strategy, while Mercedes switched Hamilton to a two-stop strategy, giving him fresher tires in the closing laps. With fresher tires, Hamilton caught and overtook Verstappen, securing the victory. Verstappen finished second, while Bottas rounded out the podium in third.</p>

                        <p>Monaco, widely considered one of the hardest tracks for overtaking, often produces processional races, and 2021 was no exception. Charles Leclerc originally took pole position for Ferrari, ended up crashing, forcing Leclerc to withdraw before the start. This promoted Max Verstappen to pole position, and he dominated the race, securing his first-ever Monaco Grand Prix victory. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton struggled with pace and strategy, spending much of the race stuck behind Pierre Gasly's AlphaTauri. Hamilton finished seventh, while Verstappen’s victory put him in the lead of the championship for the first time in his career.</p>

                        <p>After leading much of the race, Max Verstappen suffered a dramatic tire failure at high speed, causing him to crash into the wall and retire just five laps before the finish. This left Lewis Hamilton with a golden opportunity to take the championship lead, but in a shocking moment, he accidentally activated his "magic" brake setting at the restart, causing him to lock up and run deep into Turn 1. As a result, he dropped down to 15th place and scored zero points, meaning both title contenders left Baku empty-handed. </p>

                        <p>Although Lewis Hamilton managed to take the lead early in the race, Red Bull’s two-stop strategy proved to be the winning choice. However, Red Bull switched Verstappen to a two-stop strategy, while Mercedes kept Hamilton on a one-stop strategy, hoping he could defend until the end. As the race progressed, Hamilton's tires began to degrade significantly, and with just two laps to go, Verstappen—on fresher tires—overtook Hamilton to take the victory. Sergio Perez also passed Valtteri Bottas late in the race, securing a Red Bull 1-3 finish.</p>

                        <p>The Styrian Grand Prix was a dominant performance by Max Verstappen, as he led every lap. Lewis Hamilton ran in second for most of the race, but was unable to close the gap to Verstappen due to Red Bull’s superior pace at the Red Bull Ring. In the closing laps, Hamilton made a late pit stop to secure the fastest lap point, but he still finished second, over 35 seconds behind Verstappen.</p>

                        <p>For the second consecutive weekend at the Red Bull Ring, Max Verstappen delivered a dominant performance, gaining his first career Grand Slam.

                        <p>Just a few corners into the race, Verstappen and Hamilton made contact at Copse Corner, sending Max into the barriers at a massive 51G impact (500 m/s²; 1,600 ft/s²). Verstappen was forced to retire from the race, while Hamilton received a 10-second penalty for causing the collision. However, Hamilton fought back and won the race, cutting Verstappen's championship lead despite the penalty. The incident sparked heated debates over fault and driver safety. </p>

                        <p>At the race start, Valtteri Bottas misjudged his braking in wet conditions, triggering a massive first-lap crash that took out both Red Bulls and multiple other cars. Although Hamilton escaped damage, he was left as the only car on slick tires for the restart, which forced him to pit later and fight through the field. He ultimately finished third, but was later promoted to second after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified due to having insufficient fuel from the post-race sample. Meanwhile, Max, with a heavily damaged car, fought his way to 10th place, later promoted to 9th after Vettel’s DSQ, earning two crucial points. </p>

In the closing laps, Hamilton secured his 100th career win, becoming the first driver in Formula 1 history to reach this milestone. Max Verstappen finished second, while Norris, who had led for most of the race, ended up finishing seventh.</p>

The race was dominated by Hamilton, who was on course to win his eighth title, until a late-race safety car was deployed after Nicholas Latifi crashed. The FIA’s handling of the safety car restart sparked outrage, as only a select few lapped cars were allowed to un-lap themselves, setting up a one-lap shootout between Hamilton and Verstappen. With fresher tires, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap, securing his first world championship. Mercedes protested the result, but the FIA rejected the appeal. This race led to major changes in F1's race control procedures, including the removal of race director Michael Masi. </p>
