        <img src="class2021.webp" alt="Logo" class="center">
        <p>The 2021 Formula 1 season was the first full season following the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After a shortened and relatively uneventful 2020 season dominated by Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton, fans eagerly anticipated the return of a more competitive championship. Little did they know that 2021 would deliver one of the most thrilling and controversial title fights in F1 history. 
            This season saw the emergence of Max Verstappen as a serious title contender, challenging the reign of seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. With both drivers locked in an intense battle from the very first race, the championship fight would go down to the final lap of the final race—a scenario unseen in Formula 1 for nearly a decade. Throughout the season, fans witnessed dramatic crashes, controversial penalties, and breathtaking wheel-to-wheel racing, solidifying 2021 as one of the most memorable seasons in modern F1 history. </p>
